# 🕹️ E-Nira

E-Nira is a strategy-based board game built with **Pygame**. The game consists of a **placing phase** and a **moving phase**, with an AI opponent for the moving phase. Players aim to form a winning combination similar to Tic-Tac-Toe.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Placing Phase**  
   - Each player places three pieces on the board, one at a time.  
   - The goal is to place them strategically to set up future moves.  

2. **Moving Phase**  
   - Players take turns moving their pieces to an adjacent node.  
   - The AI opponent (for Blue) makes its own moves.  

3. **Winning Condition**  
   - Form a straight line of three pieces (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).   

## 🚀 Installation & Running

### 🔹 Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3** and **Pygame** installed:  
```sh
pip install pygame
