Analysis of the Game Rules and Strategies

Game Overview
The game, titled "E-Nira Game", is a two-player game implemented using Pygame. It appears to be a variant of Three Men's Morris, where players take turns placing and moving pieces on a 3x3 board until one achieves a winning combination.

Game Rules
Players and Pieces

There are two players: Orange and Blue.
Each player has 3 pieces.
Game Phases The game consists of two main phases:

Placing Phase:

Players take turns placing their three pieces on the board.
Pieces can only be placed on unoccupied nodes.
Once all pieces are placed, the game transitions to the Moving Phase.
Moving Phase:

Players take turns moving their pieces.
A piece can move only to connected and unoccupied nodes.
The goal is to align three pieces in a row, column, or diagonal.
Winning Condition

A player wins if they align their three pieces in any of the winning combinations:
Rows: (1-2-3, 4-5-6, 7-8-9)
Columns: (1-4-7, 2-5-8, 3-6-9)
Diagonals: (1-5-9, 3-5-7)
Game End and Restart

Once a player wins, a message is displayed.
The game asks whether the players want to restart (Y/N).
Strategic Insights
Placing Phase Strategy
Optimal First Placement:

The center node (5) is the best opening move because it provides the highest flexibility for forming a line.
If the center is taken, then placing at a corner (1, 3, 7, 9) is a strong alternative.
Denying Opponent Moves:

Instead of just focusing on personal advantage, place pieces in a way that blocks your opponent's future winning moves.
Moving Phase Strategy
Prioritizing a Win:

If a player can immediately move into a winning position, they should do so.
Blocking the Opponent:

Always check if the opponent has a chance to win in the next move and block them.
Controlling the Center:

The center (5) remains the strongest position.
If a player controls it, they have the highest flexibility for movement.
Baiting and Forcing Mistakes:

Sometimes, making a non-winning but aggressive move can force the opponent into a bad position.
Final Thoughts
The game is simple yet strategic, requiring both tactical placement and movement.
The first move advantage can be significant if played well.
Defensive play (blocking the opponent) is just as important as offensive play (trying to win).
Psychological play can come into effect, as predicting opponent moves is key.
